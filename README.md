# Application of Unsupervised Learning technique Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Anomaly Detection  

This repository if the for the Final Project for CU Boulder DTSA 5510: Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning.  

This project demonstrates the application of an Unsupervised Learning technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in anomaly detection.  Principal Componenent Analysis (PCA) was applied as an Unsupervised Learning technique in the identification of fraudulent credit card transactions.  The dataset used was collected by Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) and is readily available from kaggle at [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).  The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis, application of PCA technique in class predicition, performance metric assessment, and comparison with other unsupervised and supervised techniques.
